# hello-world
My First Repository! 2017
I am very new to programming but not new to computers.  I have had some web development experience, graphic design etc.  When I first became interested in Computers was using an Amstrad PCW9512 .... no windows or desktop (some twenty mmmm mm years ago).  When you wanted to make something bold you had to type in the code to turn it on and then the code to turn it off.  Moving on from there to Wordperfect 5.1 - again no windows or desktop but a similar process with turning things on and off and creating Macros for an office environment for standard letters, documents etc. And that as they say is history.  I learnt DTP on Quark Xpress on a little Mac (II) I think and from there have become proficient in Microsoft products, Adobe Dreamweaver, Fireworks on mac and pc. Have worked with html, css and asp content management solutions to create websites and edit images.  I love learning and enjoy finding solutions to problems, quicker ways to do things and love to hear "wow, that makes things so much easier!"
